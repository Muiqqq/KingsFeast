story1=King: You've been talking about utilizing\nthe food that didn't get eaten in some manner or\nanother. Queen and I decided to allow you to give\nsome of the excess food to the pigs we have here\nat the castle. The condition is that you serve my\nguests with finesse and keep them happy!
story2=King: I've been wondering about the pigs with the\nQueen. There is a concern that the pigs won't be\nable to eat all the excess food we generate. You\nwere telling us about using a composter? I'll order\none to be built immediately.
story3=King: The river has started to look a bit\ncleaner after we stopped throwing our waste in\nthere. Maybe what you're saying could have a point,\nbut I'm not totally convinced yet.
story4=King: Our pigs are well sated and we are making\na lot of usable compost. I was thinking that maybe\nwe could also distribute some of the excess food\nto my subjects. They would probably learn to respect\nme more and we would be left with even less food\nwaste. What do you think?
story5=King: You've done a great job! Our castle's\ndrinking water has been tasting a lot better than\nbefore. This must be your doing.
story6=King: Did you hear that the guests have also been\npraising our drinking water's taste lately? It was\na great idea to utilize the food waste instead of\njust throwing it all into the river. How did I not\nthink of this myself before?
story7=King: The river next to the castle looks\ncompletely different to how it did before. You have\nearned much honour for your work. I am extremely\ngrateful!
commentGreat=King: My thanks, the guests were especially happy!\nThey were flabbergasted at your ability to use the\nsling!
commentOk=King: Some guests complained they had to wait a\nlittle too long for the food. Luckily our tasty\nmeals saved the day and ultimately the guests were\nquite content. You should practice using the sling\na bit more, so that our guests don't need to sit\nat the table and be hungry for so long.
commentBad=King: The guests were upset and hungry. Luckily I\nmanaged to convince them you're new at your job.\nHopefully they still want to visit a second time.\nI hope you know that you're supposed to sling the\nfood to the guests so they can eat it, and not throw\nit on the floor.

introText=Farbert:\nWelcome to the court of Domking! My name is Lackey Farbert, and I will act\nas your guide until you learn the customs of the court. The king is happy to finally\nhave a competent cook to cater His Majesty's guests.\n\nPardon my bluntness, but I need your help. I've long been observing the large\npiles of food we throw away after feasts. His Majesty is most wonderful as a king,\nbut some habits don't seem to change. With much regret I've noticed how the river\nwe get our drinking water from has almost been destroyed. I fear it is soon too\nlate to save it, as it seems to be getting more and more eutrophic as time\ngoes on...\n\nCan you help me save the river? If you manage to cater the guests well, I'm sure\nHis Majesty will listen to your suggestions. That is how I believe we could\nchange His Majesty's and the court's habits for the better...
